TODO:

1. Finish event log.  Need to get log for current message and log the correct message to the correct log.
2. Finish the auditor implementation.
3. Finish the override file implementation.

Future:
1. Consider some kind of UI for the developer console.  Maybe host on a port or something and write an application that will connect and allow developer console connections? Maybe stick a UI in NWERP for easy access.
